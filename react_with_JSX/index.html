  // Some considerations
  /*
  * Nested components: you can add a lot of children components
  * Use className instead class
  * Javascript Expressions: we need curly braces to do js into JSX
  * Mapping arrays: we can use map for create children
  * Babel: if our code need to do support for all browser, so we need to add CDN babel into html
